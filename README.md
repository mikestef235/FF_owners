Predicting fantasy football end of year rankings (for fun!)

This notebook generates visuals and "insights" for my fantasy football league, featuring a modified Pythagorean Win Expectation model.
Not to be taken seriously, this notebook does not contain ideal formatting or procedure, enjoy!

Some takeaways are...
1. Best "Adjusted Points Scored" Seasons
2. Luckiest "Points Against" Seasons
3. Win-Loss Visuals
4. My team should win the most regular season games this year (2018-2019 season)
